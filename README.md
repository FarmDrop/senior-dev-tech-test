# Farmdrop Tech Test: Senior Developer

## The problem

Our users like music as well as food; therefore we have decided to build an application that will display interesting information about musicians. The user should be able to enter the name of a musician and see some biographical info about that person. We suspect we can use the Last.fm API to source the info. 

## Guidelines

Use any languages, platforms, APIs you like. 

Please use Git, and provide your Git history as part of your submitted solution. (Ideally just for this repository and send us a link).

You don't have to test-drive, but we'll think better of you if you do ;-)

Don't spend more than a couple of hours - we'll be happy with an incomplete solution, as long as we can see that it was moving in the right direction. 

Please update the README, specifying how to install and run the app. 

## Feedback

Was this coding test #FTW or #fail or somewhere in between? Let us know!
